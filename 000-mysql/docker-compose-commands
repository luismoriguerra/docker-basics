docker-compose up

go to http://[::]:8080/?server=mysql

# In this case, MySQL would not be accessible to the host, although Adminer could still communicate with mysql:3306 on the internal network.
# If you specify a single port value in docker-compose.yml, it is only exposed within the Docker network, e.g.,
# ports:
#   - "3306"

This specifies a level of compatibility. The -f option allows you to specify an alternative configuration filename, e.g.,

docker-compose -f ./my-config.yml up

Docker Compose can be run as a background service or in detached mode using -d. This may be practical on a live server where foreground logging is not required:

docker-compose up -d

and stopped using:

docker-compose down

Note that
$ docker-compose stop
stops containers without removing them. They can then be restarted with 
$ docker-compose start.
